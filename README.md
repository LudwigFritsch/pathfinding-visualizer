# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! Just a tool to visualize pathfinding algorithms.  
You can play around with it here: https://ludwigfritsch.github.io/PathfindingVisualizer/

## The Algorithms

**DijkstraÂ´s Algoithm** (weighted): Presumably the most popular pathfinding algorithm of them all, guarantees the shortest path.  
**A Star Search** (weighted): used in many fields of computer science, uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path.  
**Greedy Best First Search** (unweighted): a more heuristic-heavy version of A Star Search, doesn't guarantee the shortest path.  
**Breadth First Search** (unweighted): one of the most commonly used algorithms for traversing, does guarantee the shortest path.  
**Depth First Search** (unweighted): a very inefficient algorithm for the shortest-path-problem , does not guarantee the shortest path.
